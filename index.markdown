# Hello, 


I am a PhD student at the Vienna University of Economics and Business [Department of Economics](https://www.wu.ac.at/economics/mitarbeiter-innen/rapp-s/){:target="_blank"} and the [Research Institute Economics of Inequality](https://www.wu.ac.at/ineq/team/wissenschaftliche-mitarbeiter-innen/severin-rapp/){:target="_blank"}. Currently, I am visiting the [London School of Economics International Inequalities Institute](https://www.lse.ac.uk/international-inequalities){:target="_blank"}.

In 2023/2024, I am on the academic job market. Read my job market paper [here]{https://severin-rapp.github.io/assets/wealtheq_JMP}{:target="_blank"}. 

My research is about the measurement of wealth inequality and intergenerational transfers. I am interested in improving the available evidence on the distribution of wealth and bequests. This includes unearthing new data and creating tools to make data from different soucres and countries comparable. 

For my work, I received the Eduard-MÃ¤rz-Award of the Austrian Chamber of Labour and the George-Smith Award of the University of Oxford's Department of Social Policy and Intervention. Moreover, I worked with the Austrian National Bank as a [Klaus-Liebscher-Economic-Research Scholar](https://www.oenb.at/en/About-Us/Research-Promotion/scholarships_and_awards/klaus_liebscher_economic_research_scholarship.html){:target="_blank"}. As a researcher, I have consulted the City of Vienna and the Austrian Ministry for Social Affairs.
