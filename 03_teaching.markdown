## Teaching 
<p> </p>

I teach Economic and Fiscal Policy at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. The course explores institutions of economic policy, and appraises their performance in view of equity and efficiency. The course concludes by exploring how contemporary megatrends, such as golobalization and demographic change, challenge governments across the OECD. Please feel free to have a look at the original [syllabus](../assets/wipol/wipol_syllabus.pdf){:target="_blank"}, and the [slides](../assets/wipol/wipol_slides.zip){:target="_blank"}.  

At the Vienna University of Economics and Business, I designed an entire course, supported students as a supervisor (most recently in empirical work on inheritances and wealth inequality), and taught more than 250 undergraduate students overall. 

Pioneering new teaching methods, one of my seminars convened together with Lukas Lehner was awarded a [Scholarship for Teaching and Learning](https://www.wu.ac.at/mitarbeitende/infos-fuer-lehrende/scholarship-of-teaching-and-learning/gefoerderte-projekte/){:target="_blank"}.
